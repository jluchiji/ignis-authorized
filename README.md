**Ignis.js** is an opinionated framework for creating RESTful APIs. It emphasizes
modularity and reduction of coupling between modules, and therefore much better
testing experience.

## Getting Started
Ignis.js is built on top of [express](https://github.com/strongloop/express), so
you don't need to require express yourself.

You can refer to the sample application in the `example` directory for a simple
Ignis.js app.
